The

MMEND
said
on
Thursday
it
disagreed
with
MMSTART_11867
German
MMEND
advice
to
consumers
to
shun
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND

until

determine

Germany
MMEND
's
representative
to
the
MMSTART_9317
European
Union
MMEND
's
veterinary
committee
Werner
Zwingmann
said
on
Wednesday
consumers
should
buy
sheepmeat
from
countries
other
than
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
until
the
scientific
advice
was
clearer
.
*NL*
"
We
do
n't
support
any
such
recommendation
because
we
do
n't
see
any
grounds
for
it
,
"
the
MMSTART_9974
Commission
MMEND
's
chief
spokesman
Nikolaus
van
der
Pas
told
a
news
briefing
.
*NL*
He
said
further
scientific
study
was
required
and
if
it
was
found
that
action
was
needed
it
should
be
taken
by
the
MMSTART_9317
European
Union
MMEND
.
*NL*
He
said
a
proposal
last
month
by
EU
Farm
Commissioner
MMSTART_626779
Franz
Fischler
MMEND
to
ban
sheep
brains
,
spleens
and
spinal
cords
from
the
human
and
animal
food
chains
was
a
highly
specific
and
precautionary
move
to
protect
human
health
.
*NL*
Fischler
proposed
EU-wide
measures
after
reports
from
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
and
MMSTART_5843419
France
MMEND
that
under
laboratory
conditions
sheep
could
contract
Bovine
Spongiform
Encephalopathy
(
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
)
--
mad
cow
disease
.
*NL*
But
Fischler
agreed
to
review
his
proposal
after
the
EU
's
standing
veterinary
committee
,
mational
animal
health
officials
,
questioned
if
such
action
was
justified
as
there
was
only
a
slight
risk
to
human
health
.
*NL*
MMSTART_26667
Spanish
MMEND
Farm
Minister
MMSTART_6394317
Loyola

Palacio
MMEND
had
earlier
accused
Fischler
at
an
EU

ministers
'
meeting
of
causing
unjustified
alarm
through
"
dangerous
generalisation
.
"
*NL*
.
*NL*
Only
MMSTART_5843419
France
MMEND

MMSTART_31717

MMEND
backed
Fischler
's
proposal
.
*NL*
The
EU
's
scientific
veterinary
and
multidisciplinary
committees
are
due
to
re-examine
the
issue
early
next
month
and
make
recommendations
to
the
senior

officials
.
*NL*
Sheep
have
long
been
known
to
contract
scrapie
,
a
brain-wasting
disease
similar
to
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
which
is
believed
to
have
been
transferred
to
cattle
through

containing

waste
.
*NL*
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
farmers
denied
on
Thursday
there
was
any
danger
to
human
health
from
their
sheep
,
but
expressed
concern
that
MMSTART_11867
German
MMEND
government
advice
to

to
avoid
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
lamb
might
influence

told

television
.

*NL*
There

*NL*
Bonn
has
led
efforts
to
ensure
consumer
protection
tops
the
list
of
priorities
in
dealing
with
the
mad
cow
crisis
,
which
erupted
in
March
when
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
acknowledged
humans
could
contract
a
similar
illness
by
eating
contaminated
beef
.
*NL*
The
MMSTART_9974
European
Commission
MMEND
agreed
this
month
to
rethink
a
proposal
to
ban
the
use
of
suspect
sheep
tissue
after
some
EU
veterinary
experts
questioned
whether
it
was
justified
.
*NL*
EU
Farm
Commissioner
MMSTART_626779
Franz
Fischler
MMEND
had
proposed
banning
sheep
brains
,
spleens
and
spinal
cords
from
the
human
and
animal
food
chains
after
reports
from
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
and
MMSTART_5843419
France
MMEND
that
under
laboratory
conditions
sheep
could
contract
Bovine
Spongiform
Encephalopathy
(
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
)
--
mad
cow
disease
.
*NL*
But
some
members
of
the
EU
's
standing
veterinary
committee
questioned
whether
the
action
was
necessary
given
the
slight
risk
to
human
health
.
*NL*
The
question
is
being
studied
separately
by
two
EU
scientific
committees
.
*NL*
Sheep
have
long
been
known
to
contract
scrapie
,
a
similar
brain-wasting
disease
to
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
which
is
believed
to
have
been
transferred
to
cattle
through
feed
containing
animal
waste
.
*NL*
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
officials
say
sheep
meat
is
perfectly
safe
to
eat
.
*NL*
MMSTART_262201
ZDF
MMEND
said
MMSTART_11867
Germany
MMEND
imported
47,600
sheep
from
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
last
year
,
nearly
half
of
total
imports
.
*NL*
It
brought
in
4,275
tonnes
of
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
mutton
,
some
10
percent
of
overall
imports
.
*NL*
After
the
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
government
admitted
a
possible
link
between
mad
cow
disease
and
its
fatal
human
equivalent
,
the
EU
imposed
a
worldwide
ban
on
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
beef
exports
.
*NL*
EU
leaders
agreed
at
a
summit
in
June
to
a
progressive
lifting
of
the
ban
as
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
takes
parallel
measures

A

MMEND
has
found
people

*NL*
The

involved

*NL*
They
were
given
900
milligrams
a
day

There

they
wrote
in

Those
taking
part
were
told
to
eat
a

for
six
weeks
before
they
started
taking
the
pills
,
and
their

measured
before

six-week
period

The

said
this
would
make
their

*NL*
Several

*NL*
But
the

MMEND
team
disputed
these
findings
and
said
either
previous
trials
may
have
been
interpreted
incorrectly
,
those
taking
part
were
not
given
special
diets
beforehand
or
the
duration

*NL*
Lauck

MMEND
since

"

*NL*
"
He

*NL*
said

,
who
also
read
out
extracts

praising

*NL*
Publishing

distributing

material
is

MMEND
but
Lauck

team
had
argued
that

*NL*
Lauck
,
dressed
in

black

showed
no

as

spent
more

explaining
the

*NL*
But
as
Lauck
was
about

he
turned
to

blurted
out
a
virtually
incomprehensible
quick-fire

"
Neither

MMEND

"
*NL*
That
's

"
*NL*
His
attorney
,
Hans-Otto

,
told

outside

that
the

had
not
explained
how
a
MMSTART_11867

court
could
judge
someone
for
actions
carried
out
in

MMEND
.
*NL*
Bertram
said
Lauck
was
obsessed
by
MMSTART_31045316
Nazism
MMEND
and
devoted
his
life
to
leading
his
National
Socialist
German
Workers
'
Party
Foreign
Organisation
(
NSDAP-AO
)
,
which
derives
its
name
from
the
full
MMSTART_11884

title
of
MMSTART_2731583
Hitler
MMEND
's
MMSTART_21212
Nazi

party
.
*NL*
During
the
three-month

NSDAP-AO
MMEND

supremacy
and
defamatory
statements

MMEND

*NL*
The
court
rejected
Sieg
's
argument
that
Lauck
's
extradition
from
MMSTART_76972
Denmark
MMEND
,
where
he
was
arrested
in
March
last
year
at
the

was
illegal

Lauck

organisations
.
*NL*
He
will
probably
be
free
in

ruled
that

The

said
the
increase
reflected
the

an

*NL*
It
said
the
increase
was
consistent
with
the

followed
by

and
reflected
the

The

We

"
Marina

,
deputy
head
of

department
at

State

Committee
,
told
MMSTART_18998750
Reuters
MMEND
.
*NL*
Volkova
said
last
year
goods
had
been
exported
under
many
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
barter
deals
,
with
nothing
imported
in
return
.
*NL*
She
said
the
cost
of
such
unimported
goods
was
$
1.10
billion
in
1995
.
*NL*
Barter
deals
were
worth
$
4.9
billion
last
year
,
or
about
eight
percent
of
all
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
exports
estimated
at
$
61.5
billion
,
she
said
.
*NL*
"
The
cost
of
exported
goods
is
too
often
understated
,
so
the
actual
share
of
barter
deals
in
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
exports
and
the
amount
of
unimported
goods
may
be
even
higher
,
"
Volkova
said
.
*NL*
A
few
days
ago
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
President
MMSTART_23278520
Boris
Yeltsin
MMEND
issued
a
decree
on
state
regulation
of
foreign
barter
deals
,
and
Volkova
said
this
"
could
substantially
improve
the
situation
"
.
*NL*
In
line
with
the
decree
,
which
will
come
into
force
on
November
1
,
all
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
barter
traders
will
be
obliged
to
import
goods
worth
the
cost
of
their
exports
within
180
days
.
*NL*
"
If
traders
are
late
,
they
will
have
to
pay
fines
worth
the
cost
of
their
exported
goods
,
"
Volkova
said
.
*NL*
Understating
the
cost
of
exported
goods
could
still
be
a
loophole
for
barter
dealers
,
but
Volkova
said
the
authorities
are
currently
"
tackling
the
technicalities
of
the
issue
"
.
*NL*
Barter
has
always
been
a
feature
of
the
MMSTART_26779
Soviet
Union
MMEND
's
foreign
trade
,
but
MMSTART_23278520
Yeltsin
MMEND
's
decrees
liberalising
foreign
trade
in
1991-1992
has
given
barter
a
new
impetus
.
*NL*
A
few
years
ago
,
barter
deals
accounted
for
up
to
25-30
percent
of
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
exports
because
"
thousands
(
of
)
trade
companies
which
popped
up
preferred
barter
in
the
absence
of
reliable
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
banks
and
money
transfer
systems
"
,
Volkova
said
.
*NL*
"
Now
many
MMSTART_25391
Russian
MMEND
banks
are
strong
and
can
make
various
sorts
of
money
tranfers
,
while
incompetent

are
being
ousted
by
more
experienced
ones
.
*NL*
But
the

the

*NL*
With
the

resolved

MMEND
,
a
denial
that
prompted
the
MMSTART_3434750
United

MMEND
to
charge
that
the
MMSTART_5222
Colombians
MMEND
were
breaking

*NL*
He

caps

*NL*
"
Volatility
has
a

to
it
--
longer-dated

more
than
short-dated
because
the
event

now
perhaps
people
will
sell
some

buy
some
long

,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
"
Long
dated
volatility
has
been
low
this

,
so
it
is
still

*NL*
"
It

You

you

make
quite

"
*NL*
He

volatility
levels
should
be
stable
until

reassess

a

MMEND

*NL*
Paribas

OTC

Robert

said
that
if
volatility
continued
lower
for
the
rest
of
Friday
in
over-the-counter
10-year
Bunds
,
it
should
be
higher
next
Tuesday
.
*NL*
He
said
the
absence
on
holiday
of
many
market
makers
was
a
main
factor
behind
falls
this
week
in
volatility
in
high-yielding
markets
such
as
MMSTART_14532
Italy
MMEND
,
MMSTART_26667
Spain
MMEND
and
MMSTART_5058739
Sweden
MMEND
.
*NL*
Coughlan
said
the
market
had
more
downside
than
upside
potential
,
but
a
fall
was
not
likely
to
be
of
significant
size
.
*NL*
"
I
recommend
people
sell
strangles
in
a
number
of
markets
--
in
MMSTART_11867
Germany
MMEND
and
MMSTART_5843419
France
MMEND
in
particular
.
*NL*
"
With
high-yielding
markets
MMSTART_14532
Italy
MMEND
will
be
a
lot
more
vulnerable
in
September
on
economic

political
fronts
,
so
I
would
use
current
the
low
level

vol
to
buy
options
.
*NL*
"
So
sell
options
on
Bunds

MMSTART_5843419

James

of

say

natural

of
many

,
can
go
where
no

ever

*NL*
"
Any

that
when

you

"
Harvey
told
the

.
"
*NL*
That
is
why
we
know
only
about
five
percent
of
what

do
.
"
*NL*
The
sea
lions
--
17-year-old
Beaver
and
nine-year-old
Sake
--
have
undergone
six
years
of
training
for
their
mission
.
*NL*
Beaver
once

Sake

*NL*
Harvey
said
they
could
accurately
tag
whales
with
a
radio
transmitter
,
and
could
also
swim
all
the
way
around
one
of
the

,
filming
it

*NL*
Their

*NL*
The
article
did
not
spell
out
exactly
how
the
sea
lions
manage
to
tag
the
whales
but
said
in
training
they
were
taught
to
stick
a

a

of

Up
to
100,000
tonnes
of
copper
held
in
MMSTART_27643
Shanghai
MMEND
bonded
warehouses
,
confounding
the
world
market
as
to
its
source
and
ultimate
fate
,
probably
belongs
to
MMSTART_5405
China
MMEND
's
strategic
state
reserve
,
industry
sources
said
on
Friday
.
*NL*
Around
40,000
tonnes
of
the
copper
have
already
been
moved
to
warehouses
near
the
northern
port
of
MMSTART_1331885
Yingkou
MMEND
,
where
some
of
the
strategic
stockpile
was
stored
,
they
said
.
*NL*
Just
who
owns
the
copper
is
a
question
that
has
kept
traders
and
industry
analysts
guessing
since
the
metal
was
channelled
into
MMSTART_27643
Shanghai
MMEND
by
the
China
National
Nonferrous
Metals
Import
and
Export
Corp
(
CNIEC
)
in
June
and
July
.
*NL*
It
was
unclear
whether
or
not
the
40,000
tonnes
had
cleared
customs
--
which
would
provide
some
concrete
indication
that
the
strategic
reserve
,
administered
directly
by
the
central
government
's
State
Planning
Commission
,
owned
the
copper
.
*NL*
Traders
have
said
the
reserve
could
negotiate
concessions
on
duties
--
three
percent
import
tax
and
17
percent
value-added
tax
--
that
made
the
copper
prohibitively
expensive
otherwise
.
*NL*
But
one
source
,
the
head
of
a
MMSTART_13404
Hong
Kong
MMEND
trading
house
,
said
it
made
no
difference
if
the
copper
was
customs
cleared
or
not
.
*NL*
"
If
they
spend
all
this
money
moving
the
copper
to
MMSTART_1331885
Yingkou
MMEND
,
it
will
be
sitting
there
for
years
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
"
Once
it
arrives
in
MMSTART_1331885
Yingkou
MMEND
,
it
is
subject
to
monitoring
by
the
State
Planning
Commission
,
which
has
to
give
permission
for
any
more
movement
;
it
is
out
of
the
hands
of
traders
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
Mystery
has
surrounded
the
MMSTART_27643
Shanghai
MMEND
stockpile
in
recent
months
,
with
traders
unsure
not
only
of
who
owns
it
,
but
of
its
exact
size
and
what
its
owner
planned
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
Trading
sources
generally
agreed
it
would
be
cost-effective
to
take
the
copper
back
into
a
depleted
central
reserve
as
it
had
already
served
its
purpose
in
taking
advantage
of
long-term
backwardation
on
the
MMSTART_223968
London
Metal
Exchange
MMEND
(
LME
)
.
*NL*
A
backwardation
occurs
when
the
spot
price
of
a
metal
is
higher
than
the
forward
price
.
*NL*
CNIEC
lent
around
85,000
tonnes
of
copper
onto
the
LME
between
April
and
June
1995
on
behalf
of
the
state
reserve
,
running
the
state
stockpile
down
to
115,000
tonnes
from
200,000
tonnes
previously
.
*NL*
Traders
in
MMSTART_689
Asia
MMEND
said
CNIEC
could
well
have
lent
it
to
the
market
at
around
MMSTART_18717338
US$
MMEND
2,700
a
tonne
,
and
then
paid
somewhere
between
$
2,200
and
$
2,400
a
tonne
when
it
started
taking
the
metal
back
earlier
this
year
.
*NL*
This
would
have
cleared
CNIEC
a
healthy
profit
,
which
could
then
have
been
used
to
finance
storage
and
other
costs
.
*NL*
Word
that
CNIEC
had
offered
the
copper
to
MMSTART_9239
European
MMEND
trading
houses
in
a
series

unnerved

the

of

,
"

they
are

*NL*
MMSTART_1831418
Sumitomo

have

MMSTART_5405

said
they
know
nothing

an

.
*NL*
Traders
in
MMSTART_27643

MMEND
said
on
Thursday
they
were
unaware
of
movements
out
of
the
MMSTART_27643
Shanghai
MMEND
bonded
warehouses
.
*NL*
They
reported
more
arrivals
that
were
probably
spot
purchases
.
*NL*
They
also
expressed
concern
that
the
tonnage
in
bonded
warehouses
would
move
onto
the
domestic
market
.
*NL*
But
these
concerns
were
irrelevant
,
a
MMSTART_27318
Singapore
MMEND
trader
said
,
despite
a
forecast
that
domestic
MMSTART_5405
Chinese
MMEND
copper
demand
could
hit
one
million
tonnes
this
year
.
*NL*
As

"
there

a
desire
(
by

government
)

keep

"
he

when
both

aware

Dutroux
MMEND
was
building
cells
in

Dutroux
MMEND
late
last

at

house
where
Julie

Chris

did
his
best
to
forget
his
controversial
omission
from
the

MMEND
one-day
squad
on

but
could
not
prevent

Pakistan
MMEND
reasserting
their
dominance
in
the
final
test
at
MMSTART_387687
The
Oval
MMEND
.
*NL*
A
super
piece
of
fielding
by
Lewis
,
dropped
as
a
disciplinary
measure
after
arriving
only
35
minutes
before
the
start
on
the
fourth
morning
,
provided
the
only
bright
spot
for
MMSTART_759125
England
MMEND
as
the
touring
team
batted
on
to
reach
413
for
five
at
the
interval
,
a
lead
of
87
.
*NL*
The
solitary
wicket
to
fall
was
MMSTART_3976606
Asif
Mujtaba
MMEND
,
run
out
for
13
attempting
a
second
run
to
third
man
where
Lewis
was
lurking
with
a
point
to
prove
.
*NL*
There
seemed
scant
danger
until
the
MMSTART_766575
Surrey
MMEND
player
swooped
on
to
the
ball
and
returned
off
balance
to
county
team
mate
MMSTART_896414
Alec
Stewart
MMEND
who
whipped
off
the
bails
.
*NL*
Lewis
,
though
,
could
not
make
similar
waves
with
the
ball
as
MMSTART_938861
Salim
Malik
MMEND
and
MMSTART_501393
Wasim
Akram
MMEND
batted
through
the
rest
of
the
session
with
few
alarms
.
*NL*
MMSTART_501393
Wasim
MMEND
rattled
along
to
30
not
out
,
outscoring
his
partner
who
was
unbeaten
on
24
at
the
break
,
although
the
weather
was
again
threatening
to
play
the
dominant
role
.
*NL*
Rain
arrived
just
as
the
players
left
the
field
for
lunch
,
forcing
the
ground-staff
into
action
yet
again
.
*NL*
The
weather
delayed
the
resumption
for
over
an
hour
,
the
umpires
finally
announcing
play
would
start

at

That

not

*NL*
The

has
begun

*NL*
But
MMSTART_14059389
Currin
MMEND
,
who

regarded
as

said
this
was
not
the
best
way
to
achieve
the

's
aims
.
*NL*
"
A

can
be
forced
to
appear

the
only
way

going

get

is
if

feel
it

a
good

to
go
to

*NL*
At

this
is
not

*NL*
He
cited

Coetzee
MMEND
,
who
was

with
murder

*NL*
His

is
due

the

intends

decide
on
his

application
before

*NL*
MMSTART_14059389
Currin

said
the

,

began
dismantling
it
in

felt
it
carried
a

of
guilt
and
needed
to
be
exculpated
through
the

.
*NL*
"
Therefore
I
have
some
doubts
about
achieving
some
form
of

*NL*
One
has
to
feel

Professor

Presently

he

said

a

*NL*
In

the

*NL*
In

the

*NL*
Of
the
750
mid-to-large
size
corporations
surveyed
,
81
percent
had
undergone
a
major
restructuring
in
the
last
three
years
,
and
more
than
two-thirds
reported
that
productivity
and
profits
were
up
as
result
.
*NL*
Next
on
the
agenda
for
these
firms
is
developing
a
new
compensation
structure
,
and
78
percent
report
that
they
are
considering
a
new
,
skills-based
plan
for
both
management
and
non-management
employees
.
*NL*
This
coming
shift
,
O'Neal
said
,
"
is
not
just
isolated
or
a
fad
.
*NL*
It
's
an
inexorable
change
.
"
*NL*
After
MMSTART_32927
World
War
II
MMEND
,
corporations
adopted
a
"
military
model
"
creating
hierarchical
organisations
where
"
the
concept
of
defined
tasks
worked
great
,
"
she
said
.
*NL*
But
as
the
economy
became
global
,
customers
were
more
demanding
and
problems
became
more
complex
.
*NL*
"
Multi-layers
kept
management
at
a
distance
from
its
customers
,
"
O'Neal
said
.
*NL*
Now
organisations
must
change
to
stay
competitive
.
*NL*
O'Neal
says
firms
will
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
teams
and
team
performance
in
giving
raises
.
*NL*
If
your
team
does
well
,
you
'll
do
well
.
*NL*
If
it
does
n't
do
well
,
do
n't
expect
a
raise
.
*NL*
Is
this
fair
to
an
employee
who
can
go
the
distance
but
is
on
a
team
that
ca
n't
keep
up
?
*NL*
"
That
's
an
important
question
we
used

ask

,
"
said
O'Neal
.
"
*NL*
It
's
not
a
question
we
ask
any
more
.
*NL*
The
more
important
question
is
--
'
Do
we
have
results
?
'
*NL*
"
*NL*
To
get
those
results
,
27
percent
of
the
companies
surveyed
plan
to
eliminate
base
pay
increases
in
favour
of
cash
bonuses
and
incentives
,
such
as
employee
and
team
award
programmes
and
education
.
*NL*
Companies
that
can
change
their
culture
and
view
employees
as
business
partners
will
do
well
,
O'Neal
said
.
*NL*
For
example
,
the
survey
rated
some
participants
in
the
survey
as
"
high-performing
"
companies
,
based
on
their
return
on
equity
above
16
percent
.
*NL*
Those
companies
also
said
they
already
offer
employees
variable
pay
and
business
education
,
give
their
managers
more
control
over
pay
decisions
and
celebrate
employee
and
team
success
.
*NL*
"
They
respect
employees
more
,
they
trust
employees
more
and
they
value
their
employees
more
,
"
O'Neal
said
.
*NL*
"
The
key
to
success
at
high-performance
companies
is
engaging

The

While

resistant
to
MMSTART_31750

MMEND

extreme
continental
climate
,
Borsuk
said
the
lack
of
cash
in
MMSTART_31750
Ukraine
MMEND
's
agricultural
sector
is
as
bad
as
the
drought
.
*NL*
Collective

MMSTART_31750
Ukraine
MMEND
's
nascent

have
no

no

no

and
none

*NL*
This

is
down
from

,
which
in

compares
with

in

the

*NL*
The
decline
is
all
the
worse
for

who
recall
wasteful
MMSTART_26779
Soviet
MMEND
times
,
when
the

MMEND
imported
grain

priced

so
cheaply
that

it

*NL*
"

*NL*
He
said
his

its

now
readying
the

for

expected
the

to
yield
5.2

but
ended
up
with
3.9

still

*NL*
He

the

plans

the

of
the
winter

which
will
be
harvested
next

.
*NL*
Planted
in
late

early

,
the
grain
is
MMSTART_31750

and
traditionally
grows
better
than

wheat
in
MMSTART_31750

MMEND

.
*NL*
Further
plans
,
he
said
,
called
for
full

like

for
25
percent
of
MMSTART_31750
Ukraine
MMEND
's
arable

next

for
50
percent
in

and
100

of

in

.
*NL*
"
If
we
follow
this
we
'll
be
able
to
sell
10
million

of
grain
by

"
Borkus
said

*NL*
The

has
been
trying
to
phase
out
huge
subsidies
to
the
farm
sector
,

in
a
move
back

has
given
up

(
124

of

to
some
36,000
private
farmers
willing
to
go
it
alone
.
*NL*
Collective
farms
will
last
for
the

,
because
most
private

now
only
produce
enough
to

with
maybe
a
little
extra
to

,
said
one
private

:
"
In

it

Announcing

,

said
:
"
Happily
the
strong
improvement
in

not

*NL*
Gencor
raised

*NL*
"
Not

*NL*
We

*NL*
The
most
obvious
one
with
the
greatest
effect
on

was
at
Impala
where
we
had
the

"
Gilbertson
said
.
*NL*
Implats
posted
year

of

.
*NL*
Not
only
did
the

lock

but
it
suffered

*NL*
The

Nor

Ingwe

*NL*
It

*NL*
But
Gilbertson
said
the
greatest
gloom
in

came
from
the
MMSTART_9974
European

MMEND
's
blocking
of
Implats
'
proposed

with

.
*NL*
"
The
big
disappointment
for

was
the
failure
of

.
*NL*
From
Gencor
's
perspective
we
are
taking
the
position
that
it
is
not
on

"
Gilbertson
said
.
*NL*
Looking
ahead
to
the
current

he
said
that

would
boost

further

*NL*
"
Gencor

*NL*
I
think
we
can
look

"
.
*NL*
Citing
the
disposal
of
Gencor
's
stake
in
industrial
holdings
group
Malbak
Ltd
for
one
billion
rand
among
other
smaller
disposals
,
Gilbertson
said
Gencor
had
pruned
its
portfolio
to
concentrate
on
core
assets
.
*NL*
"
We
've
tried
to
clean
up
our
overall
portfolio
by
disposing
of
non-core

*NL*
The
biggest
of
those
was
Malbak
.
*NL*
Overall
a
very
substantial
pruning
...
*NL*
leaving
Gencor
clearly
structured
along

,
"
Gilbertson
said
.
*NL*
He
added
that
the

still
had
about
85
million
rand
after
tax
invested
in
various
shares
,
which
were
market
for

when
required
.
*NL*
Referring
to
Gencor
's
increased
41.5
percent
stake
in
Ingwe
,
Gilbertson
said
the
group
would
wait
for
coal
shares
to
be
cheaper
before
considering
snapping
up
more
.
*NL*
"
I
think
we
would
have

it

the

When

we

*NL*
at

maybe

The

failed
to

soccer
history
at

The

immediately
--
veteran

Although

A
message
on
television
monitors
all
around
the
National
Tennis
Centre
reads
:
"
Due
to
hot
weather
please
seek
shade
and
drink
plenty
of
fluids
"
--
sound
advice
until
you
check
out
the
price
of
fluids
.
*NL*
Perhaps
the
advisory
was
cut
off
before
concluding
:
"
...and
bring
plenty
of
money
.
"
*NL*
A
small
bottle
of
a
garishly-coloured
sports
drink
at
the
sun-drenched
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
is
going
for
$
3.75
,
while
a
litre
of
basic
,
life-sustaining
water
will
set
you
back
$
4.00
--
for
water
?
*NL*
"
At
the
MMSTART_72311
Olympics
MMEND
water
was
only
a
dollar
,
and
that
was
the
MMSTART_27566
Olympics
MMEND
,
"
said
one
incredulous
fan
,
noting
that
the
MMSTART_72311
Atlanta
Games
MMEND
had
been
notorious
for
price
gouging
.
*NL*
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
officials
managed
to
insult
most
of
the
male
tennis
players
last
week
with
their
controversial
handling
of
the
seeding
and
draw
.
*NL*
When
the
tournament
began
on
Monday
it
was
the
fans
'
turn
to
be
offended
.
*NL*
"
That
baked
lasagna
better
be
good
for
$
8.50
,
"
said
MMSTART_645042
New
Yorker
MMEND
Rebecca
Weinstein
,
a
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
regular
who
was
eating
a
sandwich
she
had
brought
from
home
.
*NL*
A
trio
of
hungry
fans
at
the
food
court
who
had
already
forked
over
the
lasagna
money
pronounced
it
good
,
but
Carol
Perry
chimed
in
,
"
The
water
is
ridiculous
,
they
want
four
dollars
for
the
water
,
you
might
as
well
get
a
glass
of
wine
.
"
*NL*
Indeed
,
a
nice
glass
of
chardonnay
or
white
zinfandel
was
going
for
$
4.75
,
while
an
imported
beer
was
just
a
bit
more
than
the
water
at
$
4.50
.
*NL*
What
's
the
message
here
?
"
*NL*
Maybe
they
want
us
to
be
alcoholics
,
"
Perry
joked
before
lifting
her
glass
of
wine
.
*NL*
Fans
will
be
shelling
out
$
12.50
for
a
hamburger
and
a
large
french
fries
.
*NL*
And
that
little
snack
is
guaranteed
to
make
you
thirsty
.
*NL*
Make
that
$
16.50
.
*NL*
Even
a
sandwich
as
pedestrian
as
a
ham
and
swiss
cheese
is
going
for
a
whopping
$
8.00
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
it
is
served
on
a
tuscan
roll
.
*NL*
It
must
be
the
cost
of
flying
those
rolls
over
from
MMSTART_21967242
Tuscany
MMEND
every
day
that
drives
up
the
price
of
the

Michael
Stich
MMEND
nearly
pulled
out
of
the
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
in
protest
over
the
men
's
seeding
fiasco
but
the
former

was
glad
he
stayed
after
sweating
out
a
four-set
win
on
Monday
over
qualifier
MMSTART_1118005
Tommy

MMEND
.
*NL*
"
I
still

I
was
about

pull
out

That
's
it

'
"
said
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
,
one
of
a
host
of
men
who
cried
foul
over
seeding
procedures
that
forced
an
unprecedented
remaking
of
the
men
's
draw
last
week
.
*NL*
"
But
there
are
so
many
reasons
to
play
,
especially
spectators
and
the
kids
who
come
out
here
and
want
to
enjoy
watching
tennis
,
that
I
decided
to
stay
.
"
*NL*
In
a
break
from
tradition
,
the
Open
did
not
seed
in
strict
accordance
with
MMSTART_627107
ATP
MMEND
rankings
,
instead
taking
into
account
other
factors
that
raised
objections
of
favourtism
toward
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
players
.
*NL*
One
prominent
player
that
did
not
stay
for
the
Open
was
MMSTART_147724
French
Open
MMEND
champion
Yvegeny
Kafelnikov
,
who
after
being
dropped
three
spots
from
his
MMSTART_627107
ATP
MMEND
ranking
to
a
seventh
seeding
,
withdrew
and
returned
home
to
MMSTART_25391
Russia
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_489963
Kafelnikov
MMEND
had
pulled
out
of
last
week
's
tournament
with
a
rib
injury
.
*NL*
At
a
news
conference
attended
by
approximately
50
players
on
Sunday
,
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
MMSTART_227983
Davis
Cup
MMEND
player
MMSTART_871725
Todd
Martin
MMEND
expressed
the
players
'
outrage
at
the
seedings
.
*NL*
"
The
way
the
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
has
seeded
here
,
tampering
with
the
ranking
system
,
has
tarnished
the
image
and
reputation
of
this
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
in
the
players
'
mind
,
and
we
think
that
is
damaging
to
our
sport
,
"
MMSTART_871725
Martin
MMEND
said
.
*NL*
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
said
he
felt
the
players
ought
to
have
organised
an
active
protest
.
*NL*
"
I
feel
that
we
made
it
a
little
easy
for
the
MMSTART_1178132
USTA
MMEND
.
*NL*
They
did
n't
really
get
hurt
as
much
as
I
think
they
should
have
,
"
said
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
.
"
*NL*
I
feel
that
we
should
have
maybe
just
cancelled
out
the
Monday
,
not
show
up
today
and
start
the
tournament
tomorrow
.
"
*NL*
But
once
the
27-year-old
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
got
on
the
court
,
he
focused
his
energies
on
trying
to
win
the
year
's
last
MMSTART_197638
Grand
Slam
MMEND
.
*NL*
He
took
a
positive
first
step
with
his
6-3
1-6
6-1
7-5
win
over
compatriot
MMSTART_1118005

MMEND
on
a
sun-baked

.
*NL*

MMSTART_913625
Sergi

of

MMEND
,
who
will
be
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
's
next
opponent
.
*NL*
The
suspicion
,
however
,
lingers
in
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
's
mind
that
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
officials
did
tamper
with
the
seeding
process
in
order
to
benefit
homegrown
players
.
*NL*
"
I
get
the
feeling
that
everything
is
done
here
for
the
MMSTART_3434750
American
MMEND
players
and
they
forget
about
all
the
other
players
,
"
said
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
,
who
lost
the
1994
Open
final
to
MMSTART_595
Andre
Agassi
MMEND
.
*NL*
It
was
MMSTART_595
Agassi
MMEND
who
was
at
the
centre
of
the
controversy
that
engulfed
the
tournament
since
the
original
draw
was
completed
on
Wednesday
.
*NL*
The
flamboyant
MMSTART_3434750
American
MMEND
star
was
bumped
up
two
spots
from
his
MMSTART_627107
ATP
MMEND
ranking
of
eight
to
a
seeding
of
six
.
*NL*
"
He
(
MMSTART_595
Agassi
MMEND
)
should
be
seeded
the
way
he
is
playing
tennis
right
now
,
"
said
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
about
the
unfairness
of
moving
up
MMSTART_595
Agassi
MMEND
,
who
made
early
exits
from
the
MMSTART_147724
French
Open
MMEND
and
MMSTART_91195
Wimbledon
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
,
not
seeded
here
for
the
first
time
since
1990
,
might
have
benefitted
from
some
fiddling
with
the
seedings
himself
after
MMSTART_489963
Kafelnikov
MMEND
withdrew
.
*NL*
Ranked
18th
in
the
world
,
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
might
have
been
slipped
into
that
spot
ahead
of
MMSTART_26667
Spain
MMEND
's
MMSTART_1723559
Felix
Mantilla
MMEND
,
who
is
16th
but
had
never
been
played
in
the
Open
and
had
been
left
out
of
the
seedings
originally
.
*NL*
But
MMSTART_979088
Stich
MMEND
did
n't
want
to
play
that
game
.
*NL*
"
I
think
he
deserves
to
be
seeded
as
everybody
else
who
is
in
the
top
16
deserves
to
be

MMSTART_23278520

took

*NL*
MMSTART_340963
Maskhadov

warned

risked
the

there
was
no

letting

something

contract
to
build
the

it

MMSTART_18743234
The

.
*NL*
The
groups
have
targeted
specific
projects
like
the
MMSTART_125325
Newbury
MMEND
bypass
and
the
M3
motorway
through
MMSTART_277942
Twyford
Down
MMEND
in
the
southern
county
of
MMSTART_13861
Hampshire
MMEND
.
*NL*
But
they
are
also
campaigning
on
broader
issue
such
as
stopping
the
government
road
building
programme
and
out-of-town
superstores
which
they
say
create
more
traffic
,
pollution
and
damage
local
communities
.
*NL*
The
government
has
slashed
its
road-building
spending
.
*NL*
Although
protests
may
have
contributed
to
the
decision
it
has
been
seen
primarily
as
economic
rather

Graham
Watts
,
chief
executive
of
the
MMSTART_9004141
Construction
Industry
Council
MMEND
,
said
:
"
I
do
n't
think
many
firms
involved
in
tendering
for
sensitive
projects
realise
the
impact
environmental
activity
has
on
the
cost
of
running
a
project
.
*NL*
"
But
they
are
more
alert
than
they
were
3-4
years
ago
.
*NL*
There
's
no
doubt
it
's
a
big
issue
now
.
"
*NL*
He
says
the
damage
comes
in
two
forms
:
"
Tangible
--
in
the
form
of
extra
costs
,
additional
security
,
threats
to
staff
and
the
more
intangible
damage
caused
by
negative
publicity
.
"
*NL*
Watts
said
the
cost
of
protesting
can
be
heavy
once
the
company
is
locked
into
a
contract
.
*NL*
"
I
do
often
hear
on
the
industry
circuit
of
tales
where
the
company
tenders
at
low
margins
and
the
demonstrations
which
follow
means
they
are
running
the
project
at
a
loss
.

*NL*

*NL*
"

*NL*
Hundreds

there

Simon

this

the

evaluates
project
risk
.
*NL*

When

Tarmac
MMEND
about
the
M3

(
through

Twyford
Down
MMEND
)
they
made
it
fairly
clear
that
their
risk
assessment
methods
have
been
changed
and
now
involve
a
very
clear
environmental
risk
analysis
.
"
*NL*
Harding
says
others
have
done
the
same
.
"
*NL*
As
a
result
of
eco-terrorism
we
are
looking
at
controversial
jobs
more
closely
to
see
if
the
profit
margins
are
wide
enough
to
cover
things
like
extra

.
"
*NL*
For
an
industry
already
suffering
from
razor-thin
margins
,
overcapacity
and
stagnant

,
eco-terrorism
is
the

bizarre

in

"
said
Tamas
Erdei
,
a
MMSTART_36787
Budapest-based
MMEND
analyst
for
ABN-AMRO
Hoare
Govett
.
*NL*
Analysts
blame
,
at
least
partly
,
MMSTART_13275
Hungary
MMEND
's
macroeconomic
environment
for
the
weaker
figures
for
Cofinec
which
,
operating
in
MMSTART_13275
Hungary
MMEND
,
MMSTART_22936
Poland
MMEND
and
the
MMSTART_5321
Czech
Republic
MMEND
,
now
generates
about
55
to
60
percent
of
its
annual
sales
from
MMSTART_13275
Hungary
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_13275
Hungary
MMEND
's
Gross
Domestic
Product
fell
one
percentage
point
in
the
first
quarter
while
real
wages
plunged
7.2
percentage
points
in
the
first
half
of
1996
.
*NL*
Both
will
have
their
impact
on
Cofinec
's
figures
,
the
analysts
said
.
*NL*
Despite
the
current
difficulties
,
however
,
analysts
were
convinced
that
Cofinec
's
outlook
was
strong
.
*NL*
"
The
eastern
MMSTART_9239
European
MMEND
market
offers
good
chances
,
"
said
Erdei
.
"
*NL*
Just
like
many
other
companies
on
the
bourse
,
Cofinec
has
big
growth
opportunities
.
"
*NL*
"
At
the
same
time
,
it
's
an
advantage
for
Cofinec
that
it
has
a
foreign
management
which
perhaps
understands
the
market
better
,
"
Erdei
added
.
*NL*
"
Cofinec
is
a
very
good
story
in
the
long-term
as
the
per
capita
packaging
consumption
is
still
so
low
in
east
MMSTART_9239
Europe
MMEND
that
a
very
strong
increase
can
be
expected
(
long-term
)
,
"
Sitanyi
said
,
saying
that
several
recent
moves
by
Cofinec
boosted
its
position
.
*NL*
Among
them
,
he
noted
that
Cofinec
had
acquired
the
outstanding
stake
in
its
MMSTART_5321
Czech
MMEND
folding
company
Krpaco
a.s.
,
increasing
its
ownership
to
100
percent
,
so
in
the
second
half
the
whole
of
Krpaco
's
figures
will
be
consolidated
.
*NL*
The
company
also
repaid
some
$
21
million
of
debt
,
well
above
the
originally
planned
$
8
million
to
$
9
million
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
its
MMSTART_22936
Polish
MMEND
operation
began
with
some
six
weeks
of
delay
due
to
cold
winter
weather
and
the
test
run
was
also
longer
than
planned
.

Yeltsin
MMEND
,

that
the
two
heart
attacks
he

a

could
be
taking
their

weakening

Russia
MMEND

1996-08-28
*NL*
The
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
Wednesday
approved
rules
designed
to
give
stock
market
investors
a
better
chance
at
getting
the
best
price
available
for
their
orders
.
*NL*
The
so-called
order
handling
rules
,
which
were
proposed
last
September
,
were
approved
in
a
4-0
vote
.
*NL*
The
new
rules
will
require
specialists
at
stock
exchanges
and
market
makers
on
MMSTART_21559
Nasdaq
MMEND
to
allow
customers
to
view
price
quotes
from
other
electronic
trading
systems
that
may
not
be
readily
available
to
them
.
*NL*
The
rules
will
also
require
that
customer
limit
orders
be
displayed
with
prices
better
than
those
available
in
quotes
publicly
available
at
the
time
.
*NL*
Specialists
and
market
makers
are
companies
or
individuals
recognised
as
qualified
to
maintain
an
orderly
market
in
a
stock
.
*NL*
In
a
limit
order
,
investors
specify
the
price
at
which
they
are
willing
to
buy
or
sell
,
as
opposed
to
a
market
order
executed
at
prevailing
prices
.
*NL*
"
These
rules
are
intended
to
empower
all
investors
,
by
allowing
their
orders
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
,
and
by
providing
the
disclosure
they
need
to
make
informed
decisions
,
"
said
SEC
Chairman
MMSTART_902148
Arthur
Levitt
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
SEC
's
goal
,
he
added
,
was
to
create
"
one
system
where
one
price
could
be
available
to
everybody
.
"
*NL*
The
director
of
the
SEC
's
division
of
market
regulation
,
Richard
Lindsey
,
said
MMSTART_37274
Wall
Street
MMEND
firms
will
probably
need
to
spend
about
$
7
million
to
carry
out
the
improvements
called
for
by
the
new
rules
.
*NL*
In
proposing
the
rules
last
year
,
the
SEC
noted
that
while
technology
has
improved
,
commonplace
practices
still
existed
that
worked
against
investors
'
best
interests
.
*NL*
It
noted
that
customers
whose
orders
were
not
displayed
lost
the
chance
of
getting
the
best
possible
price
available
in
the
market
.
*NL*
It
also
cited
the
potential
problem
of
a
two-tiered
market
in
which
market
makers
quote
one
price
to
public
investors
while
quoting
better
prices
in
private
systems
,
thus
robbing
investors
without
access
to
"
hidden
"
quotes
the
benefit
of
the
best
available
prices
.
*NL*
Earlier
this
month
,
the
SEC
settled
charges
of
alleged
malpractices
on
MMSTART_21559
Nasdaq
MMEND
when
the
parent
of
the
MMSTART_21559
Nasdaq
MMEND
market
,
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
agreed
to
spend
$
100
million
over
five
years
to
upgrade
its
oversight
of
brokers
'
trading
practices
.
*NL*
The
SEC
dropped
a
third
proposal
that
would
have
allowed
investors
with
market
orders
to
trade
at
a
better
price
if
there
were
shifts
in
prices
before
their
orders
were
executed
.
*NL*
The
agency
said
it
would
monitor
effects
of
the
two
new
rules
before
considering
the
"
price
improvement
"
proposal
again
.
*NL*
The
agency
also
proposed
rule
changes
that
would
require
continuous
"
bid
"
and
"
ask
"
quotations
from
exchange
specialists
and
market
makers
who
trade
more
than
1
percent
of
a
stock
during
any
quarter
on
MMSTART_21559
Nasdaq
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
SEC
's
limit
order
display
rule
will
mean
a
major
change
for
MMSTART_21559

Outspoken
MMSTART_702849
Andrei
Medvedev
MMEND
exchanged
his
reputation
as
the
clown
prince
of
tennis
on
Wednesday
for
a
new
no-nonsense
attitude
that
has
made
life
on
the
courts
fun
again
.
*NL*
"
I
think
I
'm
much
more
focused
on
what
I
have
to
do
,
and
that
's
playing
tennis
,
"
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
said
after
routing
MMSTART_5843419
Frenchman
MMEND
MMSTART_4026812
Jean-Philippe

MMEND
6-2
6-0
6-1
in
the
opening
round
of
the
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
.
*NL*
It
was
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
's
sixth
victory
in
a
row
after
winning
his
first
tournament
of
the
year
last
week
at
the
MMSTART_2809984
Hamlet
Cup
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
I
realised
this
year
,
that
without
putting
99.9
percent
of
your
mind
into
tennis
,
I
do
n't
think
you
can
successful
,
"
said
the
22-year-old
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
The
whole
day
I
'm
thinking
abnout
tennis
.
*NL*
I
felt
that
all
the
other
things
I
was
doing
the
years
before
,
they
were
distracting
me
,
they
were
not
helping
me
at
all
.
"
*NL*
For
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
that
meant
confining
his
post-match
comments
to
tennis
and
not
going
off
on
tirades
about
about
peripheral
issues
such
as
the
poor
quality
of
food
in
the
players
lounge
,
an
entertaining
rant
that
took
his
mind
off
the
task
at
hand
.
*NL*
"
I
know
what
I
'm
here
for
,
"
said
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
,
who
lost
in
the
second
round
of
the
Open
the
last
two
years
after
reaching
the
quarters
in
1993
,
the
same
year
he
tried
his
hand
as
a
restaurant
critic
.
*NL*
"
I
'm
not
here
to
fight
the
press
or
talk
about
the
food
or
entertain
the
people
off
the
court
.
*NL*
I
'm
here
to
play
tennis
and
to
win
.
*NL*
I
have
much
less
fun
off
the
court
.
*NL*
I
have
much
more
fun
on

,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
Just
three
years
ago
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
was
one
of
the
world
's
best
,
with
a
ranking
of
six
after
reaching
the
MMSTART_147724
French
Open
MMEND
semifinal
and
winning
three
tournaments
.
*NL*
But
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
's
ranking
slowly
began
to
drop
last
year
as
he
struggled
with
a
wrist
injury
.
*NL*
The
MMSTART_31750
Ukrainian
MMEND
finally
hit
a
low
of
44th
two
months
ago
.
*NL*
"
It
's
somewhere
where
I
would
n't
like
to
stay
very
long
,
"
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
said
of
his
current
ranking
of
36
.
"
*NL*
It
's
a
part
of
the
penalty
that
I
have
to
accept
.
"
*NL*
As
part
of
his
new
businesslike
approach
,
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
hired
MMSTART_4689264
Australian
MMEND
coach
MMSTART_26327557
Bob
Brett
MMEND
at
the
start
of
this
year
and
the
partnership
is
beginning
to
pay
off
.
*NL*
"
At
the
beginning
of
the
year
we
started
from
zero
,
"
said
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
.
"
*NL*
Winning
in
MMSTART_2809984
Long

MMEND
(

*NL*
While
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
's
77-minute
romp
past
MMSTART_4026812
Fleurian
MMEND
was
rather
ordinary
,
the
fact
that
the
two
were
playing
each
other
was
rather
remarkable
.
*NL*
In
the
original
draw
,
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
and
MMSTART_4026812
Fleurian
MMEND
were
slotted
to
play
each
other
.
*NL*
When
controversy
forced
the
draw
to
be
done
over
--
against
odds
of
151-to-1
--
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
and
MMSTART_4026812
Fleurian
MMEND
drew
each
other
a
second
time
.
*NL*
"
When
I
saw
the
new
draw
I
did
n't
have
to
change
my
preparation
,
"
MMSTART_702849
Medvedev
MMEND
said

"
*NL*
I

it
's
destined
that
it

out
for

It
was

to
be
this
hard
for

Steffi

MMEND
to
win
her

at

*NL*
But
the

rewritten
by

*NL*
Several

Basuki

,
a

around

*NL*
"
I

who

*NL*
Still
,
the
feisty
MMSTART_14579
Indonesian
MMEND
got
off
to
a
3-0
lead
in
the
tie-breaker
before
a
pair
of
costly
double
faults
gave
MMSTART_164640
Graf
MMEND
her
chance
to
avoid
a
third
set
.
*NL*
"
Usually
in
the
first
one
or
two
matches
,
you
want
to
find
your
rhythm

want
to
get
into
it

"
said
MMSTART_164640
Graf
MMEND
,
who
won
seven
of
the
last
eight
points
in
the
breaker
.
*NL*
"
To
be
in

today
,
a
couple

having

get
down

A

score
his

.
*NL*
MMSTART_549482
Smicer
MMEND
's
goal
was
as
hard-won
as
his
team
's
victory
.
*NL*
Spurred
by

leveller
five
minutes
before
,
MMSTART_1075697

win

MMSTART_1135276
Nantes
MMEND
and
confirmed
they
would
again
be
the
team
to
beat
this

.
*NL*
Ironically
,
MMSTART_357488
PSG
MMEND
's
victory
owed
a
lot
to
two
former
MMSTART_1135276
Nantes
MMEND
players
,
striker
MMSTART_3254011
Patrice
Loko
MMEND
,
who
scored
on
a
brilliant
shot
in
the
33rd
minute
,
and
defender
MMSTART_7189794
Benoit
Cauet
MMEND
,
who
started
the
one-two
which
allowed
MMSTART_3254011
Loko
MMEND
to
score
.
*NL*
The
Parisians
,
who
have
yet
to
concede
a
goal
,
were
without
MMSTART_3383
Brazil
MMEND
's
Leonardo
and
MMSTART_22997
Panama
MMEND
's
MMSTART_5887619
Julio
Cesar
Dely
Valdes
MMEND
,
both

*NL*
For
MMSTART_1135276
Nantes
MMEND
,
who
shocked
MMSTART_357488
PSG
MMEND
to
win
the
league
crown
two
years
ago
,
the
fall
is
very
painful
.
*NL*
The
Canaries
,
who
lost
most
of
their
key
players
within

years

In

MMSTART_55846

Proposition

*NL*
In
an

to
paint

,
MMSTART_55846
Dole
MMEND
said
three

during

that
illegal
drug
use
was
neither
a

Democratic
MMEND
nor
a

Republican
MMEND
issue

one
that

The

MMEND
feels

*NL*
On

he
accused

Bill

MMEND
of
"
raising

*NL*
A

U.S.
MMEND
investors
in
troubled
Lloyd
's
of
London
were
considering
late
on
Tuesday
whether
to
appeal
a
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.

court
decision
in

of

and
pledged

.
*NL*
A
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
appeals
court
on
Tuesday
gave
Lloyd
's
a
reprieve
,
throwing
out
an
injunction
that
the
insurance
giant
said
could
have
led
to
its
collapse
.
*NL*
A
lower
court
issued
the
injunction
on
Friday
and
ordered
Lloyd
's
to
give
investors
,
known
as
Names
,
more
information
before
requiring
them
to
decide
whether
to
accept
a
settlement
offer
as
part
of
a
reorganisation
plan
.
*NL*
"
My
prediction
is
that
the

will
appeal
,
"
said
Kenneth
Chiate
,
a
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
Name
and
a
chief
negotiator
for
the
American
Names
Association
.
*NL*
"
At
this
point
,
it
is
a
sufficiently
important
decision
that
I
'm
confident
that
they
will
appeal
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
But
to
say
that
they
definitely
will
would
be
premature
until
we
determine
what
the
exact
basis
for
the
court
's
ruling
is
.
"
*NL*
Under
the
reorganisation
plan
,
Lloyd
's
plans
to
reinsure
its
massive
liabilities
into
a
new
company
called
MMSTART_4659852
Equitas
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
arrangement
calls
for
investors
to
make
additional
payments
to
fund
MMSTART_4659852
Equitas
MMEND
but
also
provides
them
with
3.2
billion
stg
in
compensation
to
help
reduce
their
prior
outstanding
liabilities
.
*NL*
The
Names
had
been
scheduled
to
decide
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
offer
by
1100
MMSTART_12701
GMT
MMEND
Wednesday
,
but
Lloyd
's
chairman
David
Rowland
said
on
Tuesday
the
offer
would
be
extended
.
*NL*
At
least
eight
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.

states
have
still
some
form
of

,
said
John
Head
,

,
a

representing

*NL*
"
It

that
we

,
"
Head
said
of
the
decision
by
the
MMSTART_70228
U.S.

MMEND
for
the
MMSTART_428324
Fourth

MMEND
,
sitting

But
,
he
said
,
"

still
have

going
to

in
this
.
"
*NL*
The
MMSTART_5399
Colorado
MMEND
attorney
general
told
Lloyd
's
last
week
it
was
considering
a
new
legal
action
against
the
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
insurance
market
,
based
on
allegations
of
consumer
fraud
.
*NL*
"
We
have
notified
them
of
our
concerns
and
asked
them
to
give
us
a
response
,
"
said
MMSTART_5399
Colorado
MMEND
attorney
general
MMSTART_285196
Gale
Norton
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_285196
Norton
MMEND
said
she
was
concerned
that
the
Lloyd
's
agreement
immunizes
it
from
future
litigation
regarding
MMSTART_4659852
Equitas
MMEND
and
requires
that
all
legal
actions
be
heard
outside
of
MMSTART_5399
Colorado
MMEND
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
she
said
she
was
concerned
the
plan
may
not
offer
investors
enough
protection
from
additional
,
future
liabilities
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
an
appeal
of
a
lawsuit
filed
by
some
600
Names
in
MMSTART_5407
California
MMEND
is
still
pending
before
the
MMSTART_70228
U.S.
Court
of
Appeals
MMEND
for
the
Ninth
Circuit
,
Chiate
of
the
American
Names
Association
said
.
*NL*
That
lawsuit
,
which
seeks
rescision
and
restitution
,
was
dismissed
in
a
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
district
court
.
*NL*
That
case
"
is
what
I
call
the
most
significant
alternate
remedy
for
us
,
"
Chiate
said
.
*NL*
The
individual
Names
,
however
,
now
must
decide
whether
to
accept
Lloyd
's
settlement
offer
or
reject
the
offer
and
pursue
litigation
.
*NL*
Chiate
said
he
has
advised
Names
that
"
they
must
make
,
individually
,
a
risk
benefit
analysis
.
"
*NL*
Rejection
involved
forfeiting
the
compensation
offer
and
risking
the
possibility
of
owing
Lloyd
's
two
to
three
times
more
than
Lloyd
's
is
now
willing
to
accept
,
he
said
.
*NL*
But
,
in
rejecting
the

,
the

retain

*NL*
Weiss
said
the
MMSTART_4689264
Australian
MMEND
share
market
had
been
somewhat
negative
for
much

this
had

it

"
he

*NL*
Weiss
said
most
of
the

its

's
deputy
ambassador
,
Saeed
Hasan
,
noted
that
the
May
20
accord
said
that
the
number
of
personnel
would
be
determined
by
the
MMSTART_31769
United
Nations
MMEND
and
that
the
government
of
MMSTART_7515928
Iraq
MMEND
would
be
consulted
.
*NL*
Saeed
in
his
comments
did
not
threaten
to
call
off
the
deal
and
the
MMSTART_31769
U.N.
MMEND
officials
said
they
expected
it
to
go
into
force
next
month
after
Secretary-General
MMSTART_211193
Boutros
Boutros-Ghali
MMEND
reports
that
arrangements
are
in
place
.
*NL*
The
U.N.
Department
of
Humanitarian
Affairs
(
DHA
)
,
which
has
to
coordinate
the
distribution
of
food
,
medicine
and
other
goods
,
increased
the
number
of
monitors
earlier
this
month
at
the
insistence
of
the
MMSTART_3434750
United
States
MMEND
.
*NL*
According
to
MMSTART_31769
U.N.
MMEND
officials
and
diplomats
,
MMSTART_7515928
Iraq
MMEND
would
have
about
$
1.13
billion
to
spend
for
food
,
medicine
and
other
goods
after
monies
for
a
reparations
fund
for
MMSTART_182000
Gulf
War
MMEND
victims
and
costs
for
MMSTART_31769
U.N.
MMEND
weapons
inspections
were
deducted
.
*NL*
The
cost
of
the
MMSTART_31769
U.N.
MMEND
staff
overseeing
the
distribution
of
food
and
other
supplies
was
estimated
to
cost
$
31
million
.
*NL*
In
addition
another
$
12
million
was
anticipated
to
cover
other
expenses
,
such
as
oil
experts
and
administrative
costs
.
*NL*
For
the
distribution
and
supervision
of
humanitarian
supplies
the
MMSTART_31769
United
Nations
MMEND
estimated
it
needed
1,190
people
,
including
267
international
staff
and
923
MMSTART_7515928
Iraqi
MMEND
support
staff
.
*NL*
Of
this
number
64
foreign
and
598
local
staff
would
be
in
the
northern
MMSTART_80777
Kurdish
MMEND
provinces
,
no
longer
the
direct
control
of
the
MMSTART_7515928
Baghdad
MMEND
government
.
*NL*
Another
203
international
staff
and
325
MMSTART_7515928
Iraqis
MMEND
would
run
the
programme
in
the
central
and
southern
parts
of
the
country
.
*NL*
There
are
also
14
monitors
to
watch
oil
flows
,
32
customs
experts
and
four
MMSTART_645042
New
York-based
MMEND
oil
experts
or
overseers
to
approve
contracts
.
*NL*
MMSTART_1271160
Yasushi
Akashi
MMEND
,
the
DHA
undersecretary-general
,
told
the
MMSTART_31956
Security
Council
MMEND
last
week
that
the
"
financial
requirements
to
support
the
(

)
programme
represent
a
very
modest
percentile
of
the
total

*NL*
The
MMSTART_9974
European
Commission
MMEND
said
on
Thursday
it
would
study
scientific
reports
saying
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
's
mad
cow
epidemic
would
die
out
by
2001
but
offered
little
prospect
the
findings
would
change
an
agreed
slaughter
campaign
.
*NL*
"
Obviously
we
are
interested
in
this
research
.
*NL*
We
will
ask
the
(
EU
)
scientific
and
veterinary
committee
to
examine
it
,
"
MMSTART_9974
Commission
MMEND
spokesman
Gerard
Kiely
told
MMSTART_18998750
Reuters
MMEND
.
*NL*
But
he
added
that
new
research
into
the
dynamics
of
the
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
(
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
)
,
a
fatal
brain-wasting
disease
suffered
by
cattle
,
was
unlikely
to
alter
a
slaughter
plan
agreed
by
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
and
its
14
EU
partners
.
*NL*
"
We
agreed
that
following
detailed
scientific
analysis
using
a
methodology
which
would
take
out
the
maximum
number
of
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
cases
possible
.
*NL*
I
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
sell
to
the
MMSTART_9974
European
Commission
MMEND
a
programme
which
would
involve
the
elimination
of
fewer
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
cases
,
"
Kiely
said
.
*NL*
"
We
will
look
at
our
approach
(
to
the
plan
)
but
we
wo
n't
get
involved
with
the
number
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
"
We
have
always
avoided
the
question
of
numbers
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
that
's
not
the
issue
.
*NL*
The
issue
is
the
protection
of
consumers
'
health
and
the
rapid
eradication
of
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
,
"
he
added
.
*NL*
The
reaction
is
likely
to
disappoint
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
farmers
,
who
seized
on
research
by
MMSTART_31797
Oxford
MMEND
scientists
in
the
scientific
journal
MMSTART_43427
Nature
MMEND
saying
it
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
disease
any
faster
than
2001
without
killing
vast
numbers
of
cattle
.
*NL*
The
researchers
predicted
there
would
be
340
new
infections
and
14,000
new
cases
of
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
before
2001
.
*NL*
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
farmers
'
leader
called
on
Wednesday
for
an
urgent
meeting
with
ministers
to
discuss
the
report
.
*NL*
"
I
hope
the
government
will
now
make
it
clear
they
believe
there
is
a
better
way
of
dealing
with
this
issue
,
"
National
Farmers
Union
president
Sir
David
Naish
told
BBC
radio
.
*NL*
Naish
said
there
was
no
need
for
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
to
carry
out
a
planned
cull
of
some
147,000
cattle
to
which
it
had
reluctantly
agreed
to
placate
its
MMSTART_9317
European
MMEND
partners
.
*NL*
"
The
new
evidence
to
me
means
some
of
that
proposal
should
be
re-examined
because
we
could
get
away
with
considerably
less
animals
being
culled
if
in
fact
scientists
throughout
MMSTART_9239
Europe
MMEND
accepted
this
evidence
,
"
Naish
said
.
*NL*
The
report
could
well
reopen
a
damaging
row
between
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
and
the
EU
,
which
slapped
a
worldwide
ban
on
MMSTART_31717
British
MMEND
beef
after
the
government
said
there
could
be
a
link
between
MMSTART_19344418
BSE
MMEND
and
the
human
form
of
the
disease
.
*NL*
The
issue
flared
in
in
March
when

admitted
that
people
could
become
infected
with
MMSTART_5617
Creutzfeldt-Jakob

MMEND
(

to

a
good
impression
in
his
test
debut
at

The
Oval
MMEND
last

,
showed
great
control
as
he
first
dried
up
the
early
flow
of

MMEND
runs
and
then
collected
the
wickets
of

Wasim

chosen
to

,
MMSTART_759295
Pakistani

made

MMSTART_1436501
Sohail

MMEND
continued
their

with
an

*NL*
MMSTART_894437
Anwar
MMEND
,
who
struck
a
superb
176
at
MMSTART_387687
The
Oval
MMEND
,
was
the
more
aggressive
as
he
made
57
from
75
balls
before
skying
a
catch
off
MMSTART_2053953
Irani
MMEND
to
MMSTART_2222543
Mullally
MMEND
at
long-on
.
*NL*
MMSTART_1436501
Sohail

MMEND
struck

19
in

MMSTART_1436501
Sohail

,
after

stepped

hit

MMSTART_501393
Wasim
MMEND
,
who

Muscular

degenerates

*NL*
Death

Individuals
with
the
disease
have
a
non-working
version
of
a
gene
responsible
for
producing
a
crucial
muscle
protein
called
dystrophin
.
*NL*
In
the
study
at
the
University
's
Institute
for
Human
Gene
Therapy
,
researchers
altered
a
common-cold
virus
to
carry
a
version
of
the
working
dystrophin
gene
.
*NL*
The
virus
,
which
also
was
altered
to
minimise
its
susceptibility
to
the
immune
system
,
was
then
injected
into
the
muscle
cells
of
mice
bred
to
lack
dystrophin
genes
.
*NL*
In
the
experiment
,
between
30
to
40
percent
of
the
muscle
fibers
in
one
group
of
mice
produced
dystrophin
for
two

diminishing

Similar
results
had
been
obtained
previously
in

cultures

not
in

the

said
.
*NL*
The
university
said
methods
are
still
needed
to
make
enough
of
the
altered
virus
to
treat
humans
,
to
further
decrease
the
immune-system
response
to
the

to

Sierra
Semiconductor
Corp
jumped
23
percent
Thursday
on
the
expectation
the
company
would
emerge
as
a
smaller
but
more
profitable
operation
after
its
planned
exit
from
the
computer
modem
business
.
*NL*
The
MMSTART_53446
San
Jose
MMEND
,
MMSTART_5407
Calif.
MMEND
,
company
was
up
2-1/8
at
11-3/8
after
its
announcement
Wednesday
that
it
planned
to
pull
out
of
the
highly
competitive
modem-chip
business
and
focus
instead
on
the
fast-growing
market
for
computer
networking
equipment
.
*NL*
"
Certainly
the
company
will
be
a
much
smaller
company
now
,
but
it
will
be
a
more
profitable
business
,
"
said
analyst
Elias
Moosa
of
Roberston
Stephens
&
Co
.
*NL*
But
analysts
noted
that
Sierra
still
has
much
painful
work
ahead
of
it
,
including
cutting
as
many
as
150
jobs
from
its
workforce
,
which
currently
has
500
people
,
and
building
up
the
business
of
its
PMC-Sierra
unit
,
which
makes
routing
devices
and
chipsets
for
high-speed
computer
networks
.
*NL*
The
company
has
announced
plans
to
take
a
charge
against
earnings
of
$
50
million
to
$
80
million
to
write
down
the
value
of
assets
and
inventories
and
cover
severance
payments
.
*NL*
Scott
Randall
of
Soundview
Financial
Group
said
the
company
likely
would
have
difficulty
selling
its
modem-chip
business
.
*NL*
"
Once
you
announce
your
intention
to
exit
a
business
,
it
becomes
a
complete
buyer
's
market
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
And
he
said
that
while
the
company
is
focusing
on
the
fastest-growing
part
of
its
business
,
the
market
for
networking
chips
has
begun
to
attract
the
attention
of
much-larger
players
such
as
International
Business
Machines
Corp
.
*NL*
"
As
the
market
develops
the
question
is
,
are
they
able
to
make
that
transition
to
be
a
much
larger
company
?
"
*NL*
Randall
said
.
*NL*
Other
analysts
were
more
bullish
,
even
though
the
company
is
expected
to
shrink
to
slightly
more
than
half
its
current
size
in
sales
.
*NL*
"
It
's
a
positive
strategic
move

"
said
Miles
Kan
of

Hambrecht

MMEND
.
*NL*
"
The
modem
business
is

"
he
said
.
*NL*
The
company
's
MMSTART_790369
PMC-Sierra
MMEND
unit
generated
$
33
million
of
the
company
's
$
117

in

half
of
the
year
,
compared
with
$
45
million
in

of

,
Kan
said
.
*NL*
But
the
PMC
unit
is
far
more
profitable
,
he
said
.
*NL*
Sierra
's
stock
has
fallen
from
a
high
of
nearly
$
25
this
year
as
the
computer

been
battered
by
falling
prices
and
concern
about
slowing

had
made
in
the
past
,
Sir
Colin
Hope
said
T&N
had
taken
defensive
action
to
protect
it
from
patchy
markets
.
*NL*
Looking
at
market
prospects
,
he
said
:
"
I
think
our
best
judgment
at
this
stage
is
that
it
will
probably
bumble
along
in
the
rather
mixed
way
it
's
been
in
the
first
half
.
"
*NL*
"
It
's
very
difficult
to
predict
the
market
(
trend
)
this
year
.
*NL*
It
could
be
better
,
or
it
could
be
worse
,
"
Hope
added
,
echoing
the
demand
uncertainty
across
automotive
industries
.
*NL*
"
You
can
see
anxieties
in
MMSTART_11867
Germany
MMEND
and
MMSTART_5843419
France
MMEND
,
in
particular
,
beginning
to
grow
and
develop
.
*NL*
MMSTART_3434750
America
MMEND
,
however
,
is
looking
a
little
better
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
Compared
with
the
end
of
last
year
,
when
T&N
predicted
a
sluggish
first
half
and
a
rebound
later
in
1996
,
Hope
said
:
"
I
think
the
difference
(
now
)
is
the
first
half
has
not
actually
been
as
bad
as
some
felt
it
was
going
to
be
,
but
equally
we
're
certainly
not
predicting
a
recovery
in
the
second
half
.
"
*NL*
Against
this
background
,
Hope
said
the
group
was
glad
it
had
rationalised
and
destocked
even
though
this
had
pressed
margins
,
which
had
slipped
to
9.5
percent
from
11.3
percent
a
year
ago
.
*NL*
"
I
think
the
figure
of
9.5
percent
on
the
first
half
,
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
we
've
been
destocking
,
the
fairly
mixed
customer
demand
,
and
the
fact
that
we
sold
the
(
southern
MMSTART_5334607
African
MMEND
)
mines
actually
is
not
bad
.
*NL*
"
It
does
show
how
easily
we
should
be
able
to
bounce
back
over
10
percent
again
,
"
he
added
,
saying
:
"
We
continue
to
feel
very
relaxed
about
our
general
view
that
we
would
average
10
percent
profit
margins
over
the
cycle
.
"
*NL*
"
We
've
always
taken
the
view
that
we
are
the
sort
of
company
that
's
quite
capable
of
working
in
difficult
circumstances
--
we
're
rather
used
to
it
.
*NL*
And
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
're
doing
all
the
right
things
,
"
Hope
said
.
*NL*
"
When
the
(
profit
)
figures
will
bounce
back
up
again
is
just
a
function
of
markets
recovering
just
a
fraction
,
"
he
added
.
*NL*
Commenting
on
the
continued
struggle
to
get
control
of
MMSTART_11867
German
MMEND
piston
maker
Kolbenschmidt
,
which
has
been
hampered
by
regulatory
obstacles
,
Hope
said
T&N
's
confidence
"
continues
to
improve
"
that
it
may
eventually
be
able
to
proceed
.

The
outcome
of
the
November
elections
emerged
as
a
hot
topic
on
MMSTART_37274
Wall
Street
MMEND
this
week
as
financial
pundits
debated
whether
MMSTART_614418
Robert
Rubin
MMEND
might
forgo
a
second
term
as
MMSTART_53667
Treasury
MMEND
secretary
if
President
MMSTART_3356
Clinton
MMEND
is
re-elected
.
*NL*
Concern
centred
on
the
currency
markets
since
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
's
tour
de
force
has
been
his
unflagging
support
of
the
dollar
.
*NL*
Speculation
that
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
might
not
stay
in
his
post
grew
after
he
sidestepped
questions
about
any
future
MMSTART_32187890
Cabinet
MMEND
post
during
television
interviews
at
the
MMSTART_5043544
Democratic
MMEND
convention
in
MMSTART_6886
Chicago
MMEND
this
week
.
*NL*
Should
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
leave
,
MMSTART_37274
Wall
Street
MMEND
would
worry
that
he
might
take
his
strong-dollar
policy
with
him
.
*NL*
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
's
predecessor
at
the
MMSTART_53667
Treasury
MMEND
,
MMSTART_299257
Lloyd
Bentsen
MMEND
,
was
viewed
with
suspicion
by
some
in
the
financial
markets
who
thought
he
had
tried
to
push
down
the
dollar
to
gain
an
edge
in
trade
negotiations
with
MMSTART_15573
Japan
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
Obviously
,
under
the
MMSTART_3356
Clinton
MMEND
administration
,
we
've
seen
two
distinctively
different
dollar
policies
,
"
said
Chris
Widness
,
an
international
economist
at
Chase
Securities
Inc.
"
Under
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
,
the
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
has
certainly
looked
for
a
strong
dollar
.
"
*NL*
That
strategy
,
backed
up
by
timely
instances
of
joint
central
bank
intervention
,
helped
the
dollar
battle
back
from
post-Second
World
War
lows
of
1.3438
MMSTART_11867
German
MMEND
marks
on
March
8
,
1995
,
and
79.75
MMSTART_15573
Japanese
MMEND
yen
on
April
19
,
1995
.
*NL*
Currently
,
the
dollar
stands
at
about
1.48
marks
and
109
yen
.
*NL*
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
was
widely
hailed
as
the
architect
of
the
dollar
's
comeback
,
using
skills
and
expertise
gained
in
26
years
on
MMSTART_37274
Wall
Street
MMEND
,
part
of
which
were
spent
as
co-chairman
of
Goldman
,
Sachs
and
Co
.
Inc
.
*NL*
"
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
has
done
a
fine
job
in
that
position
,
"
said
Michael
Faust
,
a
portfolio
manager
at
Bailard
,
Biehl
and
Kaiser
,
which
manages
just
under
$
1
billion
in
global
stocks
and
bonds
.
*NL*
"
Anyone
who
would
come
in
there
to
replace
him
would
have
awfully
big
shoes
to
fill
.
"
*NL*
Fear
that
a
new
MMSTART_53667
Treasury
MMEND
secretary
might
favour
a
return
to
Bentsen-era
policy
could
spell
trouble
for
financial
markets
.
*NL*
Some
overseas
investors
might
shy
away
from
buying
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
stocks
and
bonds
or
even
sell
them
when
the
dollar
is
weakening
.
*NL*
As
for
MMSTART_53667
U.S.
Treasury
MMEND
securities
,
Widness
explained
that
MMSTART_161947
Alan
Greenspan
MMEND
's
reappointment
as
chairman
of
the
MMSTART_10819
Federal
Reserve
MMEND
and
the
outlook
for
the
federal
budget
were
more
important
than
whether
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
continues
at
the
MMSTART_53667
Treasury
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
Although
,
if
we
did
get
someone
that
was
seen
as
looking
for
a
dollar
depreciation
,
it
would
probably
hurt
capital
flows
to
the
MMSTART_3434750
United
States
MMEND
,
"
said
Widness
,
adding
that
could
hurt
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
stocks
and
,
to
a
lesser
degree
,
bonds
.
*NL*
Still
,
markets
may
have
little
to
fear
from
any
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
successor
because
the
firm
dollar
policy
has
yielded
positive
results
.
*NL*
If
that
is
true
,
then
any
new
MMSTART_53667
Treasury
MMEND
chief
would
need
to
be
as
effective
as
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
in
convincing
markets
that
the
MMSTART_33057
White
House
MMEND
does
indeed
want
a
strong
currency
.
*NL*
"
If
he
left
,
the
first
question
people
would
ask
the
next
guy
is
,
'
What
's
your
view
on
the
dollar
?
'
*NL*
"
said
Michael
Perelstein
,
portfolio
manager
of
MainStay
International
Funds
.
*NL*
"
And
all
I
can
say
as
a
piece
of
advice
is
that
they
'd
better
say
exactly
the
same
thing
(
as
MMSTART_614418
Rubin
MMEND
)
,
if
not
stronger
,
"
Perelstein
said
.
"
*NL*
Otherwise
,
you
get
selling
out
of
MMSTART_30057
Tokyo
MMEND
and
MMSTART_10992
Frankfurt
MMEND
again
.
