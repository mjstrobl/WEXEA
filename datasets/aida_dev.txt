boxing

Roberto
"
Hands

Duran
climbs
into
the
ring
on
Saturday
in
another
age-defying
attempt
to
sustain
his
long
career
.
*NL*
Duran
,

,
takes
on
little-known
MMSTART_3966054
Mexican
MMEND
Ariel
Cruz
,

,
in
a
super
middleweight
non-title
bout
in
MMSTART_57361
Panama
City
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
fight
,
Duran
's
first
on
home
soil
for
10
years
,
is
being
billed
here
as
the
"
Return

the

"
and
Duran
still
talks
as
if
he
was
in

.
*NL*
"

"
Duran
told

.
*NL*
But
those
close
to
the
boxer
acknowledge
that
the
man
who
has
won
championships
in
four
different
weight
classes
--
lightweight
,
welterweight
,
junior
middleweight
and
middleweight
--
is
drawing
close
to
the
end
of
his
career
.
*NL*
"
Each
time
he
fights
,
he
's
on
the
last
frontier
of
his
career
.
*NL*
If
he
loses
Saturday
,
it
could
devalue
his
position
as
one
of

great
boxers

*NL*
Duran
,
whose

MaliVai
Washington
MMEND
and

Rios
MMEND
were
not
so
fortunate
on
a
night
of
upsets
at
the
MMSTART_82729
U.S.
Open
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
11th-seeded
Washington
fell
short
of
reprising
his
MMSTART_91195

MMEND
miracle
comeback
as
he
lost
to

MMSTART_483554

--

MMSTART_1862751
Jeff
Tarango
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
temperamental
left-hander
defeated
the
Chilean
6-4
4-6
7-6
6-2
.
*NL*
The
day
programme
went
smoothly
although
sixth-seeded
former
champion
MMSTART_595
Agassi
MMEND
had
to
wriggle
out
of
a
dangerous
3-6
0-4
hole
,
winning
18

the
last
19
games
against
MMSTART_14533
India
MMEND

Leander

MMEND
.
*NL*
But
the
night
belonged
to
the
upstarts
.
*NL*
MMSTART_873616
Washington
MMEND
,
who
climbed
back
from
a
1-5
deficit
,
two
sets
down
in
the
third
set
against
MMSTART_871725
Todd
Martin
MMEND
in
the
MMSTART_91195
Wimbledon
MMEND
semifinals
,
looked
poised
for
another
sensational
comeback
.
*NL*
O'Brien
,
a
winner
two
weeks
ago
in
MMSTART_53825
New
Haven
MMEND
for
his
first
pro
title
,
served
for
the
match
at
5-4
in
the
third
set
before
MMSTART_873616
Washington
MMEND
came
charging
back
.
*NL*
"
I
just
kept
saying
to
myself
,
'
keep
giving
yourself
the
best
chance
to
win
,
keep
battling
,
maybe
something
will
happen
,
'
"
said
the
26-year-old
O'Brien
,
ranked
65th
.
*NL*
"
I
kept
my
composure
and
I
was
proud
of
myself
for
that
--
usually
I
would
have
folded
up
the
tent
and
gone
home
.
"
*NL*
The
hard-serving
O'Brien
,
a
former
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
collegiate
national
champion
,
fired
up
17
aces
to
ultimately
subdue
the
never-say-die
MMSTART_873616
Washington
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
fifth
set
stayed
on
serve
until
the
sixth
game
,
when
MMSTART_873616
Washington
MMEND
,
after
saving
one
break
point
with
a
forehand
winner
down
the
line
,
netted
a
backhand
to
give
O'Brien
a
4-2
lead
.
*NL*
The
Texan
blasted
in
two
aces
to
hold
serve
at
5-2
and
then
converted
his
eighth
match
point
for
victory
when
MMSTART_873616
Washington
MMEND
found
the
net
with
another
backhand
from
40-0
.
*NL*
"
You
just
kind
of
keep
fighting
and
you
keep
trying
to
make
him
play
a
little
bit
.
*NL*
I
think
he
got
a
little
tight
at
a
couple
of
moments
,
"
said
MMSTART_873616
Washington
MMEND
.
"
*NL*
But
I

to

MMSTART_1862751
Tarango
MMEND
,
whose
MMSTART_91195
Wimbledon
MMEND
tantrum
two
years
ago
brought
him
a
$
28,000
fine
and
suspension
from
this
year
's
tournament
at
the
All-England
Club
,
argued
calls
and
taunted
fans
in
his
lively
two
hour
,
24
minute
tango
with
MMSTART_483554
Rios
MMEND
on
the
grandstand
.
*NL*
A
boisterous
cheering
section
backed
the
distracted
Chilean
and
booed
the
lanky
American
,
who
ate
up
all
the
attention
.
*NL*
"
I
'm
an
emotional
player
,
"
said
the
104th-ranked
MMSTART_1862751
Tarango
MMEND
.
"
*NL*
I
think
I
played
very
well
tonight
,
very
focused
.
"
*NL*
The
match
turned
on
the
third-set
tiebreaker
,
which
the
American
won
7-5
much
to
the
dismay
of
the
spectators
.
*NL*
"
I
love
the
crowd
if
they
boo
me
every
day
.
*NL*
It
fires
me
up
,
makes
me
play
my
best
tennis

MMSTART_1862751
Tarango
MMEND
said
.
*NL*
"
I
played
some
of
my
best
tennis
in
college
when
fraternities
were
throwing
beer
on
me
.
*NL*
If
tennis
was
like
that
every

I
think
everybody
wold
be

*NL*
MMSTART_483554
Rios

did
not
appreciate
MMSTART_1862751
Tarango

's
antics

*NL*
"
He
's
always
complaining

I

*NL*
I

I
played
really
bad
.
*NL*
It
was
tough
to
play
at
night
.
*NL*
Balls
were
going
really
fast
.
*NL*
I
lost
too
many
points
that
I
never

*NL*
I
did

play
my

"
*NL*
"
I
do

day

*NL*
I
play

American
so
that
's
why
I
play
at
night
.
*NL*
I
did
n't
feel
good
on
the
court
.
"
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
match
,
MMSTART_1862751
Tarango
MMEND
blew
sarcastic
kisses
to
the
crowd
,
then
jiggled
his
body
to
a
MMSTART_483554
Rios
MMEND
rooting
section
in
a
jeering
salute
.
*NL*
"
I
support
their
enthusiasm
,
"
MMSTART_1862751
Tarango
MMEND
said
about
the
fans
.
"
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
they
're
cheering
blatantly
against
me
.
*NL*
After
I
won
I
figured
I
could
give
them
a
little
razzle-dazzle

with

rising

*NL*
But
the

complained
inflation

the

margins
on
exports
,
keeping
profits
well
below

"
the

From

up
from
37.3

*NL*
The

said
higher

anticipated
inflation

rising

wage
costs
also
hit
profits
.
*NL*
Year-on-year
inflation
,
initially
estimated

percent
in

,
was
33.8

*NL*
The

said
there

some

trick
,
they
said

will
be
for

continue
to
convince
MMSTART_21560
Wall

MMEND
that
the

MMEND

--
the

will
fall

*NL*

said
that

The

The

*NL*
Consumer
spending
barely
edged
up
in
July
,
the
MMSTART_70243
Commerce
Department
MMEND
said
Friday
,
as
income
growth
slowed
abruptly
to
the
weakest
pace
in
six
months
.
*NL*
Spending
rose
0.2
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
rate
of
$
5.15
trillion
after
dropping
a
revised
0.4
percent
in
June
.
*NL*
Incomes
from
wages
,
salaries
and
all
other
sources
gained
0.1
percent
to
a
rate
of
$
6.47
trillion
after
a
0.9
percent
jump
in
June
.
*NL*
Department
officials
said
July
's
slight
gain
in
incomes
was
the
weakest
for
any
month
since
January
,
when
they
were
flat
.
*NL*
Wages
and
salaries
came
under
pressure
in
July
as
a
shorter
average
workweek
and
lower
hourly
earnings
cut
into
paychecks
.
*NL*
The
department
said
wages
and
salaries
decreased
by
$
6.9
billion
in
July
after
climbing
$
45
billion
in
June
.
*NL*
"
In
July
,
average
weekly
hours
and
average
hourly
earnings
declined
,
more
than
offsetting
the
effect
of
an
increase
in
employment
,
"
MMSTART_70243
Commerce
MMEND
said
.
*NL*
But
more
money
went
into
savings
accounts
,
as
savings
held
at
5.3
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
in
both
June
and
July
.
*NL*
That
was
the
highest
savings
rate
since
October
last
year
,
when
5.5
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
was
being
saved
.
*NL*
The
generally
lackluster
report
on
spending
and
incomes
in
July
had
been
expected
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
the
department
said
in
a
separate
report
that
new
orders
received
by
MMSTART_3434750
U.S.
MMEND
factories
climbed
strongly
in
July
,
with
widespread
gains
across
most
major
categories
.
*NL*
Orders
increased
1.8
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
$
317.6
billion
,
significantly
stronger
than
the
1
percent
rise
forecast
by
MMSTART_21560
Wall
Street
MMEND
economists
.
*NL*
That
followed
a
revised
0.7
percent
decline
in
June
orders
.
*NL*
Commerce
said
previously
that
spending
at
retail
stores
was
up
only
0.1
percent
in
July
,
partly
because
of
softer
sales
of
new
cars
and
light
trucks
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
the
Labour
Department
's
July
employment
report
had
foreshadowed
the
muted
income
growth
.
*NL*
It
showed
average
hourly
earnings
fell
in
July
by
0.2
percent
to
$
11.00
and
the
average
workweek
shortened
to
34.3
hours
from
34.7
in
June
.
*NL*
Gains
in
personal
income
,
which
includes
wages
and
salaries
as
well
as
income
from
sources
such
as
dividends
,
interest
and
businesses
,
are
essential
for
funding
consumer
purchases
,
which
fuel
two-thirds
of
national
economic
activity
.
*NL*
Spending
on
all
types
of
durable
goods
,
which
includes
cars
,
fell
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
626.3
billion
in
July
from
$
633.6
billion
in
June
.
*NL*
But
spending
on
nondurable
products
increased
moderately
to
a
rate
of
$
1.55
trillion
from
$
1.54

in

,
while
spending
for

reduced

15

*NL*
Shortly
afterwards

Roberto

found

an
off-day
,
highlighted
by

*NL*
MMSTART_860422
Mehrtens

missed
three
further
penalties
and
a
conversion
in
the

40
minutes
which

have
put
his

ahead
,
but
it
was
the
MMSTART_376115

MMEND
who
looked
the
more
dangerous
.
*NL*
Their
promise
was
realised
when
Joubert
made
a
40-metre
break
in
the
25th

and
,
although

A

HONG

*NL*
Controversial
MMSTART_4689264
Australian
MMEND
Anthony
Hill
called
MMSTART_2525758
Jansher
Khan
MMEND
a
cheat
during
his
acrimonious
defeat
by
the
world
number
one
in
the
Hong
Kong
Open
semifinals
on
Saturday
.
*NL*
The
match
boiled
over
when
Hill
made
to
walk
off
court
after
what
he
claimed
was
a
game-winning
point
in
the
third
.
*NL*
When
the
referee
called
MMSTART_2525758
Jansher
MMEND
's
return
good
and
the
decision
was
accepted
by
the
player
,
Hill
shrieked
at
the
Pakistani
:
"
You
cheat
.
"
*NL*
"
He
was
standing
right
there
and
knew
the
shot
was
down
so
I
called
him
a
cheat
,
"
said
Hill
,
whose
squash
career
has
been
blighted
by
fines
and
suspensions
for
unacceptable
behaviour
.
*NL*
"
He
knew
it
was
down
and
accepted
what
I
called
him
because
of
that
.
"
*NL*
Hill
won
the
game
on
the
next
point
and
said
later
that
MMSTART_2525758
Jansher
MMEND
was
generally
honest
on
court
but
played
by
the
referee
's
decision
.
*NL*
The
Australian
had
upset
MMSTART_2525758
Jansher
MMEND
's
rhythm
with
his
mixture
of
gamesmanship
and
fluent
stroke-making
but
eventually
succumbed
15-7
17-15
14-15
15-8
.
*NL*
"
I
changed
my
strategy
against
him
today
and
had
him
rattled
,
"
he
added
.
*NL*
He
is
not
as
fit
as
he
used
to
be
be
but
was
too
good
for
me
in
the
end
.
*NL*
I
shook
him
a
bit
but
he
will
come
out
next
time
and
be
a
better
player
for
it
--
that
's
Jansher
.
"
*NL*
MMSTART_2525758
Jansher
MMEND
said
that
he
was
disturbed
to
be
called
a
cheat
.
"
*NL*
What
he
did
was
bad
for
squash
,
bad
for
the
crowd
and
bad
for
the
sponsors
.
*NL*
"
We
are
trying
to
build
up
squash
like
tennis
and
players
should
not
say
things
like
that
.
*NL*
"
I
think
the
MMSTART_1210559
Professional
Squash
Association
MMEND
should
look
into
this
matter
and
deal
with
it
properly
.
*NL*
I
am
not
calling
for
him
to

*NL*
MMSTART_391932
Edberg

off

*NL*
MMSTART_391932
Edberg

lost

twice

to

his
decision
to
make
the
film

he
wrote
himself

it

more
about
history

any

statement

The
film
spares
neither
the

the

British
MMEND
in
its
depiction
of

whose
1992

also
came
under

what

perceived
as
a
sympathetic
portrayal
of
the

,
said
MMSTART_97509
Collins
MMEND
was
more

just
a

"
MMSTART_97509
Collins
MMEND
would
never

Much
of

Noting
that
information
about

MMEND
was
"
as
mysterious
as
the
existence
he
maintained
"
,
MMSTART_315569
Jordan
MMEND
said
he
made
some
historical
assumptions
in
the
film
.
*NL*
"
I
have
made
choices
about
certain
events
based
on
my
own
extensive
research
into
his
letters
and
reported
speeches
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
I
wanted
to
make
this
a
story
as
accurate
as
possible
without
killing
it
dramatically
and
I
think
I
have
.
*NL*
It
is
a
very
true
film
.
"
*NL*
One
of
the
assumptions
is
his
interpretation
of
the
murky
circumstances
surrounding
the
shooting
death
of
MMSTART_97509
Collins
MMEND
,
who
had
broken
with
his
comrades
when
he
sought
a
negotiated
settlement
with
MMSTART_31717
Britain
MMEND
,
in
an
ambush
in

*NL*
"
I
have
never
lost
more
sleep
over
the
making
of

I
have
over

I
'll
never

one

"
In
